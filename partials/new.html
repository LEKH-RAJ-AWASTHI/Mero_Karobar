    <p>
        <strong>Profit Maximization:</strong><br>
        Profit maximization is a traditional and straightforward objective for businesses. It refers to the process
        of increasing profits as much as possible in the short term. This means making decisions that generate the
        highest possible difference between total revenue and total costs. In the context of profit maximization,
        companies focus on maximizing their net income or profits within a specific time frame.

        <strong>Wealth Maximization:</strong><br>
        Wealth maximization is a broader and more modern approach to financial management. It aims to increase the
        overall value of the firm and its shareholders over the long term. Unlike profit maximization, wealth
        maximization considers the time value of money, risk factors, and the interests of all stakeholders, not just
        shareholders.
